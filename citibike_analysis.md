# NYC CitiBike Analysis 
This analysis was completed to help understand the feasibility of starting a bike sharing program in Des Moines. New York City has a successful program called CitiBike. We will utilize data from CitiBike to assist in examining the possibilities.

## Tools for Analysis
Tableau was our primary tool for analyzing and visualizing the data. We acquired data from the CitiBike website on bike utilization in NYC during August 2019. We also considered information from the U.S. Census Bureau, TripAdvisor, and Catch Des Moines websites. A completed Tableau Story is visible at the following link: [link to story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.campbell5493#!/vizhome/BikeSharingOpportunity/DesMoinesBikeShare)

## Opportunity in Des Moines
Des Moines is a bikeable city and seems like it would be a good candidate for bike sharing. A quick look at our first map and one can see that the top 10 attractions according to TripAdvisor are all within a distance that is bikeable. The city is also a growing city. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 2010 t0 2019 the population grew 4.9% to 214,237. As more people move into the downtown area, the demand for transportation options will increase. It is also a city that has a large number of tourists. In 2016 there were 13.7M visitors, which was up 5% from 2015.

## NYC CitiBike Program 
The NYC CitiBike Program is an established bike sharing program for a city of over 8 million people and over 60 million visitors each year. We should be able to glean some key insights into bike sharing that will help us decide about a bike sharing program in Des Moines.

### Subscribers vs. Customers
Subscribers are defined as users that have a recurring monthly charge for using CitiBikes within the city. Customers are those that pay on a per use basis for the bikes. In NYC the majority (81%) of users are subscribers. This could indicate that most users are residents since they would be more inclined to maintain a subscription. Tourists may not be as comfortable riding bikes in the city. We should research further to better understand the residents of Des Moines and thier tendancy to use a bike sharing program.

### CitiBike Stations
CitiBike stations are conveniently located all over the city. Lower Manhattan and Midtown stations tend to get the most use. We would need additional analysis to determine if this is from tourism or from residents biking from/to work.

### Age of Users and Utilization
There are a wide range of ages that utilize the CitiBike program. Younger riders do appear to ride more. Knowing this can help us develop advertising programs for younger people to urge them to use bike sharing.

### Gender and Bike Sharing
In New York City, 65% of the users are men. This could be another indication that residents traveling to and from work are the primary users since women may not be dressed appropriately to ride bikes when going to work.

### Hours of Utilization
The hours between 5 and 7 PM are when utilization is the highest. Between 2 and 5 AM the bikes are used the least and would be a good time for performing maintenance.

## Summary
Bike sharing is successful in many cities across the United States. It could be a good program for Des Moines but further analysis is needed of the local market.
